    "abstract": "  In this work we introduce a new optimisation method called SAGA in the spirit of SAG, SDCA, MISO and SVRG, a set of recently proposed incremental gradient algorithms with fast linear convergence rates. SAGA improves on the theory behind SAG and SVRG, with better theoretical convergence rates, and has support for composite objectives where a proximal operator is used on the regulariser. Unlike SDCA, SAGA supports non-strongly convex problems directly, and is adaptive to any inherent strong convexity of the problem. We give experimental results showing the effectiveness of our method. ",

    "abstract": "  Tensors are higher-order extensions of matrices. While matrix methods form the cornerstone of machine learning and data analysis, tensor methods have been gaining increasing traction. However, software support for tensor operations is not on the same footing. In order to bridge this gap, we have developed \\emph{TensorLy}, a high-level API for tensor methods and deep tensorized neural networks in Python. TensorLy aims to follow the same standards adopted by the main projects of the Python scientific community, and seamlessly integrates with them. Its BSD license makes it suitable for both academic and commercial applications. TensorLy's backend system allows users to perform computations with NumPy, MXNet, PyTorch, TensorFlow and CuPy. They can be scaled on multiple CPU or GPU machines. In addition, using the deep-learning frameworks as backend allows users to easily design and train deep tensorized neural networks. TensorLy is available at https://github.com/tensorly/tensorly ",

    "abstract": "  Variable selection for Gaussian process models is often done using automatic relevance determination, which uses the inverse length-scale parameter of each input variable as a proxy for variable relevance. This implicitly determined relevance has several drawbacks that prevent the selection of optimal input variables in terms of predictive performance. To improve on this, we propose two novel variable selection methods for Gaussian process models that utilize the predictions of a full model in the vicinity of the training points and thereby rank the variables based on their predictive relevance. Our empirical results on synthetic and real world data sets demonstrate improved variable selection compared to automatic relevance determination in terms of variability and predictive performance.

    "abstract": "HIV RNA is an acknowledged marker of disease activity and predictive of progression, while the p24 antigen is considered unsuitable. This is at odds with the fact that viral pathogenesis is usually mediated by proteins. One might expect that p24, if analyzed properly, might even be superior to RNA. This hypothesis was investigated in clinical studies using a sensitive and precise p24 test (heat-mediated immune complex dissociation with signal amplification-boosted ELISA). This test was as sensitive and specific as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for viral RNA (200-400 copy detection), an overall better predictor of CD4 decline and survival, while RNA prevailed in predicting AIDS. The lower costs of p24 testing also permit a closer monitoring of patients with an earlier detection of anti-retroviral treatment failures.",

    "abstract": "Most successful vaccines elicit neutralizing antibodies and this property is a high priority when developing an HIV vaccine. Indeed, passively administered neutralizing antibodies have been shown to protect against HIV challenge in some of the best available animal models. For example, antibodies given intravenously can protect macaques against intravenous or mucosal SHIV (an HIV/SIV chimaera) challenge and topically applied antibodies can protect macaques against vaginal SHIV challenge. However, the mechanism(s) by which neutralizing antibodies afford protection against HIV is not understood and, in particular, the role of antibody Fc-mediated effector functions is unclear. Here we report that there is a dramatic decrease in the ability of a broadly neutralizing antibody to protect macaques against SHIV challenge when Fc receptor and complement-binding activities are engineered out of the antibody. No loss of antibody protective activity is associated with the elimination of complement binding alone. Our in vivo results are consistent with in vitro assays indicating that interaction of Fc-receptor-bearing effector cells with antibody-complexed infected cells is important in reducing virus yield from infected cells. Overall, the data suggest the potential importance of activity against both infected cells and free virus for effective protection against HIV.",

We illustrate this HOSVD with an integration of genome-scale mRNA expression data from three yeast cell cycle time courses, two of which are under exposure to either hydrogen peroxide or menadione. We find that significant subtensors represent independent biological programs or experimental phenomena. The picture that emerges suggests that the conserved genes YKU70, MRE11, AIF1, and ZWF1, and the processes of retrotransposition, apoptosis, and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway that these genes are involved in, may play significant, yet previously unrecognized, roles in the differential effects of hydrogen peroxide and menadione on cell cycle progression. A genome-scale correlation between DNA replication initiation and RNA transcription, which is equivalent to a recently discovered correlation and might be due to a previously unknown mechanism of regulation, is independently uncovered.",

    "abstract": "IgG antibodies are potent inducers of proinflammatory responses. During autoimmune diseases such as arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, IgG autoantibodies are responsible for the chronic inflammation and destruction of healthy tissues by cross-linking Fc receptors on innate immune effector cells. The sugar moiety attached to the asparagine-297 residue in the constant domain of the antibody is critical for the overall structure and function of the molecule. Removal of this sugar domain leads to the loss of the proinflammatory activity, suggesting that in vivo modulation of antibody glycosylation might be a strategy to interfere with autoimmune processes. In this work, we investigated whether removal of the majority of the IgG-associated sugar domain by endoglycosidase S (EndoS) from Streptococcus pyogenes is able to interfere with autoimmune inflammation. We demonstrate that EndoS injection efficiently removes the IgG-associated sugar domain in vivo and interferes with autoantibody-mediated proinflammatory processes in a variety of autoimmune models. Importantly, however, we observed a differential impact of EndoS-mediated sugar side chain hydrolysis on IgG activity depending on the individual IgG subclass.",

    "abstract": "In vivo, the activity of antibodies relies critically on properties of both the variable domain, responsible for antigen recognition, and the constant domain, responsible for innate immune recognition. Here, we describe a flexible, microsphere-based array format for capturing information about both functional ends of disease-specific antibodies from complex, polyclonal clinical serum samples. Using minimal serum, we demonstrate IgG subclass profiling of multiple antibody specificities. We further capture and determine the subclass of epitope-specific antibodies. The data generated in this array provides a profile of the humoral immune response with multi-dimensional metrics regarding properties of both variable and constant IgG domains. Significantly, these properties are assessed simultaneously, and therefore information about the relationship between variable and constant domain characteristics is captured, and can be used to predict functions such as antibody effector activity.",

    "abstract": "In order to survey a universe of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-presented peptide antigens whose numbers greatly exceed the diversity of the T cell repertoire, T cell receptors (TCRs) are thought to be cross-reactive. However, the nature and extent of TCR cross-reactivity has not been conclusively measured experimentally. We developed a system to identify MHC-presented peptide ligands by combining TCR selection of highly diverse yeast-displayed peptide-MHC libraries with deep sequencing. Although we identified hundreds of peptides reactive with each of five different mouse and human TCRs, the selected peptides possessed TCR recognition motifs that bore a close resemblance to their known antigens. This structural conservation of the TCR interaction surface allowed us to exploit deep-sequencing information to computationally identify activating microbial and self-ligands for human autoimmune TCRs. The mechanistic basis of TCR cross-reactivity described here enables effective surveillance of diverse self and foreign antigens without necessitating degenerate recognition of nonhomologous peptides.",

    "abstract": "Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV-1 provide both effective pre-exposure prophylaxis and treatment of HIV-1 infection in murine and nonhuman primate models, suggesting their potential use in humans. Although much is known about the role of variable domains in the neutralization breadth and potency of these bNAbs, the contribution of Fc domains to their activities is, by contrast, poorly characterized. Assessment of the in vivo activity of several bNAbs revealed that FcγR-mediated effector function contributes substantially to their capacity to block viral entry, suppress viremia, and confer therapeutic activity. Enhanced in vivo potency of anti-HIV-1 bNAbs was associated with preferential engagement of activating, but not inhibitory FcγRs, and Fc domain-engineered bNAb variants with selective binding capacity for activating FcγRs displayed augmented protective activity. These findings reveal key roles for Fc effector function in the in vivo activity of anti-HIV-1 bNAbs and provide strategies for generating bNAbs with improved efficacy. ",

    "abstract": "The N-glycan of the IgG constant region (Fc) plays a central role in tuning and directing multiple antibody functions in vivo, including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, complement deposition, and the regulation of inflammation, among others. However, traditional methods of N-glycan analysis, including HPLC and mass spectrometry, are technically challenging and ill suited to handle the large numbers of low concentration samples analyzed in clinical or animal studies of the N-glycosylation of polyclonal IgG. Here we describe a capillary electrophoresis-based technique to analyze plasma-derived polyclonal IgG-glycosylation quickly and accurately in a cost-effective, sensitive manner that is well suited for high-throughput analyses. Additionally, because a significant fraction of polyclonal IgG is glycosylated on both Fc and Fab domains, we developed an approach to separate and analyze domain-specific glycosylation in polyclonal human, rhesus and mouse IgGs. Overall, this protocol allows for the rapid, accurate, and sensitive analysis of Fc-specific IgG glycosylation, which is critical for population-level studies of how antibody glycosylation may vary in response to vaccination or infection, and across disease states ranging from autoimmunity to cancer in both clinical and animal studies.

    "abstract": "The adaptive immune response to vaccination or infection can lead to the production of specific antibodies to neutralize the pathogen or recruit innate immune effector cells for help. The non-neutralizing role of antibodies in stimulating effector cell responses may have been a key mechanism of the protection observed in the RV144 HIV vaccine trial. In an extensive investigation of a rich set of data collected from RV144 vaccine recipients, we here employ machine learning methods to identify and model associations between antibody features (IgG subclass and antigen specificity) and effector function activities (antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis, cellular cytotoxicity, and cytokine release). We demonstrate via cross-validation that classification and regression approaches can effectively use the antibody features to robustly predict qualitative and quantitative functional outcomes. This integration of antibody feature and function data within a machine learning framework provides a new, objective approach to discovering and assessing multivariate immune correlates. ",

The complement system is initiated by conformational changes in recognition molecular complexes upon sensing danger signals. The subsequent cascade of enzymatic reactions is tightly regulated to assure that complement is activated only at specific locations requiring defense against pathogens, thus avoiding host tissue damage. Here, we discuss the recent advances describing the molecular and structural basis of activation and regulation of the complement pathways and their implication on physiology and pathology. This article will review the mechanisms of activation of alternative, classical, and lectin pathways, the formation of C3 and C5 convertases, the action of anaphylatoxins, and the membrane-attack-complex. We will also discuss the importance of structure-function relationships using the example of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. Lastly, we will discuss the development and benefits of therapies using complement inhibitors. ",

    "abstract": "While antibody titers and neutralization are considered the gold standard for the selection of successful vaccines, these parameters are often inadequate predictors of protective immunity. As antibodies mediate an array of extra-neutralizing Fc functions, when neutralization fails to predict protection, investigating Fc-mediated activity may help identify immunological correlates and mechanism(s) of humoral protection. Here, we used an integrative approach termed Systems Serology to analyze relationships among humoral responses elicited in four HIV vaccine trials. Each vaccine regimen induced a unique humoral \"Fc fingerprint.\" Moreover, analysis of case:control data from the first moderately protective HIV vaccine trial, RV144, pointed to mechanistic insights into immune complex composition that may underlie protective immunity to HIV. Thus, multi-dimensional relational comparisons of vaccine humoral fingerprints offer a unique approach for the evaluation and design of novel vaccines against pathogens for which correlates of protection remain elusive.",

    "abstract": "Elite controllers (ECs) represent a unique model of a functional cure for HIV-1 infection as these individuals develop HIV-specific immunity able to persistently suppress viremia. Because accumulating evidence suggests that HIV controllers generate antibodies with enhanced capacity to drive antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) that may contribute to viral containment, we profiled an array of extra-neutralizing antibody effector functions across HIV-infected populations with varying degrees of viral control to define the characteristics of antibodies associated with spontaneous control. While neither the overall magnitude of antibody titer nor individual effector functions were increased in ECs, a more functionally coordinated innate immune-recruiting response was observed. Specifically, ECs demonstrated polyfunctional humoral immune responses able to coordinately recruit ADCC, other NK functions, monocyte and neutrophil phagocytosis, and complement. This functionally coordinated response was associated with qualitatively superior IgG3/IgG1 responses, whereas HIV-specific IgG2/IgG4 responses, prevalent among viremic subjects, were associated with poorer overall antibody activity. Rather than linking viral control to any single activity, this study highlights the critical nature of functionally coordinated antibodies in HIV control and associates this polyfunctionality with preferential induction of potent antibody subclasses, supporting coordinated antibody activity as a goal in strategies directed at an HIV-1 functional cure.

    "abstract": "Signaling proteins display remarkable cell-to-cell heterogeneity in their dynamic responses to stimuli, but the consequences of this heterogeneity remain largely unknown. For instance, the contribution of the dynamics of the innate immune transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) to gene expression output is disputed. Here we explore these questions by integrating live-cell imaging approaches with single-cell sequencing technologies. We used this approach to measure both the dynamics of lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-κB activation and the global transcriptional response in the same individual cell. Our results identify multiple, distinct cytokine expression patterns that are correlated with NF-κB activation dynamics, establishing a functional role for NF-κB dynamics in determining cellular phenotypes. Applications of this approach to other model systems and single-cell sequencing technologies have significant potential for discovery, as it is now possible to trace cellular behavior from the initial stimulus, through the signaling pathways, down to genome-wide changes in gene expression, all inside of a single cell.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies play an essential role in host defence against pathogens by recognizing microorganisms or infected cells. Although preventing pathogen entry is one potential mechanism of protection, antibodies can control and eradicate infections through a variety of other mechanisms. In addition to binding and directly neutralizing pathogens, antibodies drive the clearance of bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites via their interaction with the innate and adaptive immune systems, leveraging a remarkable diversity of antimicrobial processes locked within our immune system. Specifically, antibodies collaboratively form immune complexes that drive sequestration and uptake of pathogens, clear toxins, eliminate infected cells, increase antigen presentation and regulate inflammation. The diverse effector functions that are deployed by antibodies are dynamically regulated via differential modification of the antibody constant domain, which provides specific instructions to the immune system. Here, we review mechanisms by which antibody effector functions contribute to the balance between microbial clearance and pathology and discuss tractable lessons that may guide rational vaccine and therapeutic design to target gaps in our infectious disease armamentarium.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies are highly functional glycoproteins capable of providing immune protection through multiple mechanisms, including direct pathogen neutralization and the engagement of their Fc portions with surrounding effector immune cells that induce anti-pathogenic responses. Small modifications to multiple antibody biophysical features induced by vaccines can significantly alter functional immune outcomes, though it is difficult to predict which combinations confer protective immunity. In order to give insight into the highly complex and dynamic processes that drive an effective humoral immune response, here we discuss recent applications of 'Systems Serology', a new approach that uses data-driven (also called 'machine learning') computational analysis and high-throughput experimental data to infer networks of important antibody features associated with protective humoral immunity and/or Fc functional activity. This approach offers the ability to understand humoral immunity beyond single correlates of protection, assessing the relative importance of multiple biophysical modifications to antibody features with multivariate computational approaches. Systems Serology has the exciting potential to help identify novel correlates of protection from infection and may generate a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms behind protection, including key relationships between specific Fc functions and antibody biophysical features (e.g. antigen recognition, isotype, subclass and/or glycosylation events). Reviewed here are some of the experimental and computational technologies available for Systems Serology research and evidence that the application has broad relevance to multiple different infectious diseases including viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites.",

    "abstract": "The results of the RV144 HIV vaccine, in combination with several recent non-human primate vaccine studies continue to highlight the potentially protective role of non-neutralizing Fc functional antibodies in HIV vaccine design. For many currently licensed vaccines, assays that detect antigen-specific antibody titers or neutralization levels have been used as a correlate of protection. However, antibodies can confer protection through multiple other mechanisms beyond neutralization, or mechanisms which are not dependent on total antibody titers. Alternative strategies that allow us to further understand the precise mechanisms by which antibodies confer protection against HIV and other infectious pathogens is vitally important for the development of future vaccines. Systems serology aims to comprehensively survey a diverse array of antibody features and functions, in order to simultaneously examine the mechanisms behind and distinguish the most important antibody features required for protection, thus identifying key targets for future experimental vaccine testing. This review will focus on the technical aspects required for the application of Systems serology and summarizes the recent advances provided by application of this systemic analytical approach.",

We report advances in a humoral immunoprofiling approach and its application to elucidate hallmarks of effective HIV-1 viral control. Systematic serological analysis for a cohort of HIV-infected subjects with varying viral control was conducted using both a high-resolution, high-throughput biophysical antibody profiling approach, providing unbiased dissection of the humoral response, along with functional antibody assays, characterizing antibody-directed effector functions such as complement fixation and phagocytosis that are central to protective immunity. Profiles of subjects with varying viral control were computationally analyzed and modeled in order to deconvolute relationships among IgG Fab properties, Fc characteristics, and effector functions and to identify humoral correlates of potent antiviral antibody-directed effector activity and effective viral suppression. The resulting models reveal multifaceted and coordinated contributions of polyclonal antibodies to diverse antiviral responses, and suggest key biophysical features predictive of viral control.",

    "abstract": "Many immune receptors transduce activation across the plasma membrane through their clustering. With Fcγ receptors (FcγRs), this clustering is driven by binding to antibodies of differing affinities that are in turn bound to multivalent antigen. As a consequence of this activation mechanism, accounting for and rationally manipulating immunoglobulin (Ig)G effector function is complicated by, among other factors, differing affinities between FcγR species and changes in the valency of antigen binding. In this study, we show that a model of multivalent receptor-ligand binding can effectively account for the contribution of IgG-FcγR affinity and immune complex valency. This model in turn enables us to make specific predictions about the effect of immune complexes of defined composition. In total, these results enable both rational immune complex design for a desired IgG effector function and the deconvolution of effector function by immune complexes.",

    "abstract": "HIV-specific broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) confer protection after passive immunization, but the immunological mechanisms that drive their development are poorly understood. Structural features of bNAbs indicate that they originate from extensive germinal center (GC) selection, which relies on persistent GC activity. However, why a fraction of infected individuals are able to successfully drive more effective affinity maturation is unclear. Delivery of antigens in the form of antibody-immune complexes (ICs), which bind to complement receptors (CRs) or Fc receptors (FcRs) on follicular dendritic cells, represents an effective mechanism for antigen delivery to the GC. We sought to define whether IC-FcR or CR interactions differ among individuals who develop bNAb responses to HIV. Enhanced Fc effector functions and FcR/CR interactions, via altered Fc glycosylation profiles, were observed among individuals with neutralizing antibody responses to HIV compared with those without neutralizing antibody activity. Moreover, both polyclonal neutralizer ICs and monoclonal IC mimics of neutralizer antibodies induced higher antibody titers, higher-avidity antibodies, and expanded GC B cell reactions after immunization of mice via accelerated antigen deposition within B cell follicles in a complement-dependent manner. Thus, these data point to a direct role for altered Fc profile/complement interactions in shaping the maturation of the humoral immune response, providing insights into how GC activity may be enhanced to drive affinity maturation in next-generation vaccine approaches.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies are the primary correlate of protection for most licensed vaccines; however, their mechanisms of protection may vary, ranging from physical blockade to clearance via the recruitment of innate immunity. Here, we uncover striking functional diversity in vaccine-induced antibodies that is driven by immunization site and is associated with reduced risk of SIV infection in nonhuman primates. While equivalent levels of protection were observed following intramuscular (IM) and aerosol (AE) immunization with an otherwise identical DNA prime-Ad5 boost regimen, reduced risk of infection was associated with IgG-driven antibody-dependent monocyte-mediated phagocytosis in the IM vaccinees, but with vaccine-elicited IgA-driven neutrophil-mediated phagocytosis in AE-immunized animals. Thus, although route-independent correlates indicate a critical role for phagocytic Fc-effector activity in protection from SIV, the site of immunization may drive this Fc activity via distinct innate effector cells and antibody isotypes. Moreover, the same correlates predicted protection from SHIV infection in a second nonhuman primate vaccine trial using a disparate IM canarypox prime-protein boost strategy, analogous to that used in the first moderately protective human HIV vaccine trial. These data identify orthogonal functional humoral mechanisms, initiated by distinct vaccination routes and immunization strategies, pointing to multiple, potentially complementary correlates of immunity that may support the rational design of a protective vaccine against HIV.",

    "abstract": "How can we extract hidden relations from a tensor and a matrix data simultaneously in a fast, accurate, and scalable way? Coupled matrix-tensor factorization (CMTF) is an important tool for this purpose. Designing an accurate and efficient CMTF method has become more crucial as the size and dimension of real-world data are growing explosively. However, existing methods for CMTF suffer from lack of accuracy, slow running time, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose S3CMTF, a fast, accurate, and scalable CMTF method. In contrast to previous methods which do not handle large sparse tensors and are not parallelizable, S3CMTF provides parallel sparse CMTF by carefully deriving gradient update rules. S3CMTF asynchronously updates partial gradients without expensive locking. We show that our method is guaranteed to converge to a quality solution theoretically and empirically. S3CMTF further boosts the performance by carefully storing intermediate computation and reusing them. We theoretically and empirically show that S3CMTF is the fastest, outperforming existing methods. Experimental results show that S3CMTF is up to 930× faster than existing methods while providing the best accuracy. S3CMTF shows linear scalability on the number of data entries and the number of cores. In addition, we apply S3CMTF to Yelp rating tensor data coupled with 3 additional matrices to discover interesting patterns.",

    "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) interacts with the immune system throughout the course of infection. For most of the disease process, HIV activates the immune system, and the degree of activation can be assessed by measuring serum levels of molecules such as beta 2-microglobulin and neopterin, as well as other serum and cell surface phenotype markers. The levels of some of these markers correlate with clinical progression of HIV disease, and these markers may be useful as surrogate markers for development of clinical AIDS. Because the likelihood and timing of development of clinical AIDS following seroconversion, for any particular individual, are not readily predictable, the use of nonclinical disease markers has become critically important to patient management. Surrogate markers of HIV infection are, by definition, measurable traits that correlate with disease progression. An ideal marker should identify patients at highest risk of disease progression, provide information on how long an individual has been infected, help in staging HIV disease, predict development of opportunistic infections associated with AIDS, monitor the therapeutic efficacy of immunomodulating or antiviral treatments, and the easily quantifiable, reliable, clinically available, and affordable. This review examines the current state of knowledge and the role of surrogate markers in the natural history and treatment of HIV infection. The clinical usefulness of each marker is assessed with respect to the criteria outlined for the ideal surrogate marker for HIV disease progression.",
